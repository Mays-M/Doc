In the first challenge there were 4 different files base on my strength and knowledge
I chose to work with media.txt

- Created a python code which reads Base64-encoded image data from a file,
decodes it, creates a PIL Image object, saves it to a file, and attempts to
display the image. If any issues occur during this process, it handles the
exceptions and prints an error message
