# CH01
In the first challenge there were 4 different files base on my strength and knowledge
I chose to work with media.txt

- Created a python code which reads Base64-encoded image data from a file,
decodes it, creates a PIL Image object, saves it to a file, and attempts to
display the image. If any issues occur during this process, it handles the
exceptions and prints an error message

- After running the program: python3 ch01.py
- Flag successfully found which was printed as a data in the picture that produced from the code that read the media data.
- Inside the image print the target flag
